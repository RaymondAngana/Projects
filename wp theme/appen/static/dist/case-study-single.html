                    <p>This dataset contains annotated Hematoxylin & Eosin (H&E) images, one of the most commonly used image types in histopathology. There images were cropped from 30 whole slide images (WSIs) of digitized tissue samples of seven organs from The Cancer Genomic Atlas (TCGA). Further, only one WSI per patient was used in order to maximize nuclear appearance variation.</p>
                    <p>These images came from 18 different hospitals, which introduced another source of appearance variation due to the differences in the staining practices across labs. The size of each cropped images is 1000 x 1000 pixels which is cropped from dense region of tissue. To further ensure richness of nuclear appearances, the dataset covered seven different organs, which are breast, liver, kidney, prostate, bladder, colon, and stomach, including both benign and diseased tissue samples.</p>
                    <p>These 30 cropped images contained more than 21000 nuclei annotated and validated by medical experts.This dataset can be used by the research community to develop and benchmark generalized nuclear segmentation techniques that work on diverse nuclear types.</p>
                    <p>Nuclear segmentation in digital microscopic tissue images can enable extraction of high quality features for nuclear morphometric and other analyses in computational pathology. Nuclear morphometric and appearance features such as density, nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio, size and shape features, and pleomorphism can be helpful for assessing not only cancer grades but also for predicting treatment effectiveness. This dataset can be used by the research community to develop and benchmark generalized nuclear segmentation techniques that work on diverse nuclear types.</p>
